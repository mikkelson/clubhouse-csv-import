# Clubhouse.io CSV Import

This is a simple PHP app that turns a CSV file into stories *(bug, chore, feature)* using the [Clubhouse v3 API](https://clubhouse.io/api/v3/).

There is no framework or package manager, just a few lines of PHP and a pleasant UI built on the [Skeleton CSS framework](http://www.getskeleton.com)
